ML based learning app for spreading awareness against child sexual abuse among Bangladeshi parents
A survey was conducted among 3000 Bangladeshi parents and caregivers and the resultant data was analyzed using five machine learning approaches LR, MNB, SVM, DT, RF, and CNN. 
The Random Forest classifier outperformed the rest of the approaches both in accuracy( 94\%) and speed once integrated with the application.
The application is written in flutter language and connected to a server using RESTful API.
When parents open the application, it evaluates their knowledge on CSA prevention through a quiz. Based on the results of the quiz, parents knowledge is categorized into Beginner or Intermediate. 
Then, he/she is redirected to prevention material based on his knowledge level. After each lesson, a quiz is presented to evaluate learnings.
The study reveals the lack of awareness on part of Bangladeshi parents' and caregivers regarding the threat of child sexual abuse. The proposed system to educate parents in CSA prevention methods will be a valuable asset for raising awareness among Bangladeshi parents and caregivers regarding the threat of CSA.
